;; Port range for incoming RTP streams.
;;
;; These two parameters define the minimum and maximum ports that Kurento Media
;; Server will open (bind to) in order to receive RTP packets from remote peers.
;; This affects the operation of both RtpEndpoint and WebRtcEndpoint.
;;
;; * Unit: port number.
;; * Default: [1024..65535]. This is the whole range of non-privileged ports.
;minPort=1024
;maxPort=65535

;; Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) used for RTP.
;;
;; This setting affects the maximum size that will be used by RTP payloads. You
;; can change it from the default, if you think that a different value would be
;; beneficial for the typical network settings of your application.
;;
;; The default value is 1200 Bytes. This is the same as in libwebrtc (from
;; webrtc.org), as used by Firefox [1] or Chrome [2].  You can read more about
;; this value in "Why RTP max packet size is 1200 in WebRTC?" [3].
